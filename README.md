# Developing-an-Image-Classifier-with-Deep-Learning

In this project, we will train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We will be using this dataset of [102 flower categories](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html).

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on the dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content
